    - Om necklace
    - "Om necklace for men .\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The syllable om is first described as all-encompassing mystical entity in the Upanishads. Today, in all Hindu art and all over India and Nepal, 'om' can be seen virtually everywhere, a common sign for Hinduism and its philosophy and theology. Hindus believe that as creation began, the divine, all-encompassing consciousness took the form of the first and original vibration manifesting as sound \"OM\".\r\n\
      \r\n Before creation began it was \"Shuny\xC4\x81k\xC4\x81sha\", the emptiness or the void. Shuny\xC4\x81k\xC4\x81sha, meaning literally \"no sky\", is more than nothingness, because everything then existed in a latent state of potentiality. The vibration of \"OM\" symbolizes the manifestation of God in form (\"s\xC4\x81guna brahman\"). \"OM\" is the reflection of the absolute reality, it is said to be \"Adi Anadi\", without beginning or the end and embracing all that exists.\r\n\
      \r\n The mantra \"OM\" is the name of God, the vibration of the Supreme. When taken letter by letter, A-U-M represents the divine energy (Shakti) united in its three elementary aspects: Bhrahma Shakti (creation), Vishnu Shakti (preservation) and Shiva Shakti (liberation, and/or destruction)."
