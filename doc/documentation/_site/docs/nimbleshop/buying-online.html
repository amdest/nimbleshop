<p>John is checking out the Amazon.com site and he wants to buy a book. At the checkout page he enters his credit card information and hits submit.</p>

<p>When he bought his coffee at Starbucks, the card reader read the credit card information, converting it in such a way that the information could be sent to the banking network.</p>

<p>When credit card information is accepted over the internet, then something equivalent of the &#8220;card reader&#8221; is needed which will convert the credit card number and other information to a data format that can be sent to the banking network. This is what Gateways do. Popular Gateways are <a href='http://www.authorize.net/'>Authorize.net</a>, <a href='http://www.braintreepayments.com/'>Braintree</a> and <a href='https://samurai.feefighters.com/'>Samurai</a>.</p>

<p>In short, Gateways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept credit card information in a web friendly manner.</li>

<li>Encode the information and then send it to the merchant bank.</li>

<li>Once the response is received, they decode the response.</li>

<li>They forward the response information to the web application that made the request through API.</li>
</ul>
