<h1 id='debit_cards'>Debit cards</h1>

<p>Credit cards are not directly linked to your bank account. Credit card issuing company sends a statement to the user and user pays the bill. Unlike credit cards, debit cards are linked to bank accounts. When debit card is swiped then money is withdrawn the bank account.</p>

<p>Since the debit cards are less risky compared to credit cards, the &#8220;interchange fee&#8221; charged by Visa and Mastercard is a lot less of debit cards.</p>

<p>When you use credit card then you are slowly building your credit card as long as you pay the bills on time. When you pay using debit card then your credit history is being built.</p>

<p>Credit card provides strong protection to consumers. Consumers can issue chargeback and money will be refunded to them. As per <a href='http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-3100.html'>Regultation E</a> of FDIC, a credit card user is liable for $50 as long as the user contacts the bank within 2 days of the transaction. After 2 days and upto 60 days user is liable for upto $500. And after two months user is liable for full amount.</p>
