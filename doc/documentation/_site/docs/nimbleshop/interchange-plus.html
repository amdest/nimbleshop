<h1 id='interchange_plus_pricing'>Interchange Plus Pricing</h1>

<p>Some credit card processors offer &#8220;interchange plus pricing&#8221;. What this means is that these credit card processors clearly tell their clients that they will charge whatever the interchange fee is. On top of that, they will charge their processing fee. That is why it is called &#8220;interchange plus&#8221;. The &#8220;plus&#8221; stands for the processing fee taken by the credit card processor.</p>

<p>Since all the credit card processors must incur the same &#8220;interchange fee&#8221;, this model makes it easier to compare rates between one credit card processor and the next. Many credit card processors do not offer &#8220;interchange plus pricing&#8221; because it is so easy to compare the pricing between two credit card processors.</p>

<p>Business owners who use interchange plus are assured of the markup the credit card processor is earning on each transaction.</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s take a look at the website <a href='http://www.petroleummerchant.com/intercharge_plus.html'>PetroleumMerchant.com</a>. They advertise their rate as</p>
<img src='https://img.skitch.com/20110923-qqm449y8x5gs49ad5paj4ij.jpg' />
<p>One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.</p>

<p>Here the credit card processor is stating that the total fee incurred by the business will be the interchange fee + assessments fee + 0.01% + $0.05 per transaction. The (0.01% + $0.05 per transaction) is the credit card processors&#8217; fee.</p>

<h2 id='example_number_two'>Example Number Two:</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the rate offered by <a href='http://www.mainstreetmerchantsolutions.com/interchange_plus_merchant_accounts'>Main Street Merchant Solutions</a>.</p>

<p>They are offering <img src='https://img.skitch.com/20110923-bgukt21un8puhh6fnp18rirkdx.jpg' /></p>

<p>In this case the processor&#8217;s markup is (0.30% + $0.10 per transaction).</p>

<p>Notice how easy it is to compare the pricing of &#8220;Main Stree Merchant Solutions&#8221; to &#8220;Petroleum Merchant&#8221;. Petroleum Merchant offers fewer services and hence their pricing is lower.</p>

<p>With &#8220;interchange plus&#8221;, business owners are able to compare pricing and see what services they are getting.</p>
