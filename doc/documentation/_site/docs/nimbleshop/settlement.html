<h1 id='settlement'>Settlement</h1>

<p>Previously, we saw that John swiped his credit card and he got a receipt. This means that his credit card was charged $4.00. However, it does not mean that immediately after the transaction, the bank handling the Starbucks account received $4.00. Starbucks does not get John&#8217;s money immediately. In order to get the money, Starbucks has to submit all the transactions done during the day for &#8220;settlement&#8221; in a batch process. Typically, these batch processes are executed at night. During this settlement process, all transactions done during the day are &#8220;settled&#8221;. It is during this nightly batch procedure that the $4.00 is credited to the Starbucks account and $4.00 is charged to John&#8217;s credit card.</p>

<p>Until &#8220;settlement&#8221; occurs, John&#8217;s credit card charge is in the &#8220;captured&#8221; state. &#8220;Captured&#8221; means that the money was authorized from John&#8217;s account and it is ready for settlement. During settlement, money is sent to the correct recipient.</p>
