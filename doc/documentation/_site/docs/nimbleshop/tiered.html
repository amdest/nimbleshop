<h1 id='tiered_pricing'>Tiered Pricing</h1>

<p>A credit card processor does not want to talk about hundreds of different rates to a business person. To avoid this, they usually place all the various interchange rates into three different buckets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Qualified discount rate</li>

<li>Mid Qualified discount rate</li>

<li>Non Qualified discount rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the credit card processor only has to talk about three different categories. But here is the catch. In the advertisements, you will see the lowest published rate. While selling the service to you, the credit card processor will always talk about the Qualified Discount Rate.</p>

<p>In reality, when your customers swipe their credit cards, a great many transactions will not qualify for the &#8220;Qualified Discount Rate&#8221;. What are some of the reasons why transactions will not be charged the lowest bucket rate?</p>

<ul>
<li>Card not swiped.</li>

<li>Rewards cards. Cards which earn free miles, hotel points etc.</li>

<li>Corporate cards. Cards issued by corporations to their employees.</li>

<li>Customer’s zip code did not match the data on file.</li>

<li>Cards were not settled within the given timeframe.</li>

<li>Other factors</li>
</ul>

<p>By some estimates around 80% of the transaction do not qualify for &#8216;Qualified Discount Rate&#8217;.</p>
