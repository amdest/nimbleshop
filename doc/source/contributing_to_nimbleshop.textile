h3. Reporting an Issue

nimbleShop uses "GitHub Issue Tracking":https://github.com/bigbinary/nimbleshop/issues to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in nimbleShop, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull requests.

h4. Special Treatment for Security Issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities with public GitHub issue reports. Please send an email to security@nimbleshop.org .

h3. Contributing to Documentation

NOTE: To help our CI servers you can add [ci skip] to your documentation commit message to skip build on that commit. Please remember to use it for commits containing only documentation changes.
