endprologue.

Paypal offers a lot of products. nimbleShop has built-in support for "Paypal website payments standard":https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/wp_standard . Paypal website payments standard has following attractive features:

* Buyer can pay using their Paypal account or they can pay using their credit card.
* Buyer does not need to have paypal account to pay using credit card. This feature is very compelling. It means users who do not have a paypal account even they can make payment using their credit card.
* There is no setup fee.
* There is no monthly fee.


h3. Using paypal sandbox

We do not need to have a real paypal account to test . We are going to use +paypal sandbox+.

h4. Signup at paypal sandbox

First step is signing up at "https://developer.paypal.com":https://developer.paypal.com . Paypal will send a confirmation link to validate your email address. Go signup and confirm the email address before moving to next step.

h4. Create test accounts

Visit "https://developer.paypal.com":https://developer.paypal.com and login.

Click on +create a preconfigured account+ link .

Lets create an account for buyer.

After the buyer account has been created you will see page like this

Notice that even though I had typed the buyer email address as +buyer@mailinator.com+ paypal change the email address to +buyer_1341965839_per@mailinator.com+. This is normal and do not worry about it.

Next lets create a seller account. Click on +Home+ to come back to homepage and then click on +Create a preconfigured account+ link.

Enter all the information for seller. Make sure to select third radio button which is meant for seller.

After the seller account has been created the page will look like this

!https://img.skitch.com/20120711-1fui4ars8a4rxb8errw7a3sy3e.jpg!

Again even though I entered seller email address as +seller@mailinator.com+ the email address was changed to +seller_1341966113_biz@mailinator.com+. That is okay and do not worry about it.

h3. Use forward

Paypal sends a callback and Paypal can't send callback to
+localhost:3000+ . So you need a way to expose your application that is
running on local port +3000+ to have a public name. You can use any tool
you want. I prefer to use "https://forwardhq.com/":https://forwardhq.com
.

Once you have the url then open +config/nimbleshop.yml+ and replace the
value for the key +localhost2public_url+ .

h3. Configure nimbleShop to use seller email

* Visit "Admin tab Payment methods":http://localhost:3000/admin/payment_methods .
* Click 'Paypal' vertical tab
* Update +Merchant email+ with seller email address that you got. I am going to enter +seller_1341966113_biz@mailinator.com+ .
* Save the record.

h3. Instant payment notification in paypal

Now lets go and buy something. At the payment page select +Paypal+ radio button.

You will be taken to a page. Enter the buyer email address. I am going to enter +buyer_1341965839_per@mailinator.com+ and password +welcome1+. Hit Submit.

In the next page select the checkbox and click +Agree and Continue+.

In the next page click on 'Pay Now'.

If everything goes fine then you should see this page

h3. Verify payment at papal account page

Now lets confirm the payment by visiting the account page at paypal.

Come back to the and the page should look like this

!https://img.skitch.com/20120711-jpymjnqs3y4ffcyy9tpaawq1ww.jpg!

Click on 'Enter Sandbox Test Site'. That should open a popup  Here you should see a transaction record for the amount you paid. This is what I see.
