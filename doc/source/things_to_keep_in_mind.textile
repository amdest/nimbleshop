h3. Contributing to Documentation

Documentation for nimbleShop is under +doc+ directory in the github repo. Follow [the README](https://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop/tree/master/doc) instructions to build the documtation.

nimbleShop uses [Travis ci](http://travis-ci.org/) to run tests anytime a commit is made. However documentation changes do not require tests to be run again. To help Tavis team keep the cost low you are encourage to add  [ci skip] to your documentation commit message to skip running tests for that commit.
