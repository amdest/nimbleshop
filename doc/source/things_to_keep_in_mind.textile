h3. Contributing to Documentation

Documentation for nimbleShop is under +doc+ directory in the github repo. Follow "the README":https://github.com/nimbleshop/nimbleshop/tree/master/doc to build the documentation.

nimbleShop uses "Travis ci":http://travis-ci.org as continuous integration (CI) server. However documentation changes do not require tests to be run. To help Tavis team keep the cost low you are encourage to add  [ci skip] to your documentation commit message to skip running tests for that commit.
