h3. What is nimbleSHOP?

nimbleSHOP is an open source e-commerce application. It works with Ruby on Rails.

nimbleSHOP works only with ruby 1.9.2 and above.

nimbleSHOP uses PostgreSQL. No code is written specifically for PostgreSQL so MySQL and other databases should work. However all tests are run against PostgreSQL.

nimbleSHOP is not a gem yet. It should become a gem soon.

h3. Getting started

<shell>
$ git clone xxxxx
</shell>

<shell>
$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
</shell>

Enter the credetials of your PostgreSQL database in <tt>database.yml</tt>.

<shell>
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:bootstrap
rails server
</shell>

Now if you visit <tt>http://localhost:3000</tt> you should see your store.
