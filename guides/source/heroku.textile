h3. Pingdom

For good or the bad nimbleSHOP has totally embraced heroku. Since heroku has buitin support for postgresql, nimbleSHOP decided to use postgresql. So far no code is written specifically for postgresql so nimbleSHOP should work fine with MySQL and other databases. However note that all the tests are run only for postgresql.
pingdom has a free account which can allow you to ping a site every 5 minutes or every 1 minute. This pinging will not let you dyno go down if you are using the basic free plan from heroku.
