h3. Merchant account

In order to accept credit cards online, store owners need to have a merchant account. "Here is a good read":http://ebooks.bigbinary.com/docs/credit-cards/index.html on how credit card works and what exactly is a merchant account.

h3. Authorize.net

Authorize.Net is a payment gateway service provider allowing merchants to accept credit card and electronic checks paymentsn. Authorize.Net claims a user base of over 305,000 merchants, which would make them the Internet's largest payment gateway service provider.

nimbleSHOP has built in support for Authorize.net .

Authorize.net provides an instant "test account":https://developer.authorize.net/testaccount . Use this test account while your application for merchant account is still being processed. You can enter your account credentials at <tt>config/application.yml</tt>.

<ruby>
gateway_authorize_net_login_id: <%= ENV['GATEWAY_AUTHORIZE_NET_LOGIN_ID']  || '56yBAar72' %>
gateway_authorize_net_transaction_key: <%= ENV['GATEWAY_AUTHORIZE_NET_TRANSACTION_KEY'] ||  '9r3pbH5bnKH29f7d' %>
</ruby>

As you can see the application already has credentials of a test account. You can use that account for testing but before you go 'live' you should enter your own merchant account credentials.

If you do not want to put your Authorize.net credentials in <tt>application.yml</tt> then you can provide that information using <tt>ENV</tt>. Look at "deployment with heroku" guide for more information about how to pass environment variable to the application.
